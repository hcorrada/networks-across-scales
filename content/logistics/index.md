## Textbook and Resources:

We will refer to the following two textbooks frequently:

- Newman, M.E.J. (2010) _Networks, An Introduction_. Oxford University Press. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Networks-Introduction-Mark-Newman/dp/0199206651/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=Z4KKMKQBBRDZB7092JB9i)
- Barabasi, et al. (2016) _Network Science_. Cambridge University Press. [Book Site](http://barabasi.com/networksciencebook/)
- Kolaczyk and Csardi (2014) _Statistical Analysis of Network Data with R_. Springer. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Analysis-Network-Data-Use/dp/1493909827/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=JVA5EYS5TPS6G0SZ9197) [ELMS](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1227944/files)

Other readings will be posted in the [Course Calendar]({{< baseurl >}}/calendar/index.html).

## Expected outcomes and topics covered

At the end of this course, students will be able to describe,
implement and analyze algorithms that solve fundamental problems in
biological network analysis: descriptive summaries of network structure and properties, probabilistic and dynamical network models, statistical models for networked data and network visualization. They will also be able to apply these methods to data in networks from biological applications: molecular, neuronal and ecological networks by completing a semester-long project.


## Expectations for Students


### Class prep

The [Course Calendar]({{< baseurl >}}/calendar/index.html) will list
readings (uploaded to [ELMS]({{< elmurl >}})). **You are
required to read this material before lecture**

### Presentations

Students will present frequently during class. Groups will present project updates as it pertains to the analytical methods discussed throughout the semester. Students will also present papers discussing state-of-the-art methods in each of the course units.

### Announcements and discussion

We will use the [Piazza page]({{< piazzaurl >}}) for class
announcements. Please use the [Piazza page]({{< piazzaurl >}}) for
*all discussion*.

### Other policies

* There will be reading assignments. Students are expected to have read the material **before** class.  
* Students are expected to attend lectures. Active participation is expected. There will be graded work done in class.  
* Students will be expected to present project progress reports and papers during class. 
* Assignments are to be handed-in electronically or in class as instructed on their due date. Late assignments will not be accepted.  
 Students may discuss homeworks and projects in groups. However, each
  student must write and/or program solutions independently.  
* Cell phone usage is **prohibited** during lecture, laptop use will be allowed to the extent that students **demonstrably** use it to follow along an in-class analysis or demonstration.  

### Grading Procedures 

* Data project milestone submissions (30%, divided between multiple milestone submissions)  
* Final data project submission (15%)  
* Paper presentations (20%)  
* Participation and discussion (10%)  
* Written homeworks (25%)
