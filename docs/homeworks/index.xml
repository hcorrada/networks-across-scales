Data Download timeseries data derived from the ADHD-200 resting fMRI samples (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/).
https://www.hcbravo.org/networks-across-scales/ data/roi_timeseries.csv.
The data consists of standardized measurements over 176 time points of 39 regions of interest (ROI). The rows of the data correspond to the 39 regions, the first column contains a label indicating the name of the brain ROI, with the remaining columns corresponding to the fMRI timeseries.
Correlation Network Build a correlation network from the timeseries data as follows:</description>

We will use ecological network data from the paper &amp;ldquo;How Structured is the Entangled Bank?&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; by Kefi et al. http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002527. This paper used Stochastic Block Models to analyze both trophic and non-trophic species interaction networks. Your goal in this homework is to (a) partially replicate some of the analyses in the paper, and reanalyze this data using other statistical methods for analysis.</description>

In our previous homework you generated the degree distribution of a genetic interaction network:
Note: you can obtain a csv file with the adjacency matrix for the genetic interaction dataset here: https://www.hcbravo.org/networks-across-scales/ data/genetic_interaction.csv.gz.
Question 1: Is this degree distribution consistent with a network generated by the Erd√∂s-Renyi network model? Why?
Fitting the degree distribution Use a network analysis library to estimate the degree exponent under a power-law model for the genetic interaction network.</description>

Data Obtain data for the year genetic interaction network at http://thecellmap.org/costanzo2016/. Download data in matrix format from http://thecellmap.org/costanzo2016/data_files/Raw%20genetic%20interaction%20datasets:%20Matrix%20format.zip, and after unzipping use file Data File S2. Raw genetic interaction datasets: Matrix format/SGA_NxN_clustered.cdt This is a tab-separated value file with the following format:
 The first five rows contain metadata. Rows six to the end contain interaction data The first six columns also contain metadata.</description>

      <title>Setting up R</title>

      <description>For class we will be using R, Rstudio and git. You can download and install each using the links below. However, you can instead use Rocker, a project built on top of Docker to manage your software installation. We&amp;rsquo;ve setup a container that will provide you with a working installation of R, and the Rstudio IDE, along with a lot of packages providing analysis tools and datasets we will use throughout the semester.</description>
