You will implement approximate string matching using a seed-and-check strategy based on exact matching using the Burrows-Wheeler transform. We are providing starter code to get you going. Instructions on implementation and code are here:
https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/hcorrada/cmsc423_project4
I highly, highly recommend that you use git
To get code you will be using for this project using git:</description>

Programming Questions Submit your answers to Problems 4 and 5 in the Rosalind final submission page.
Question 1. (5 pts) Write three or four sentences as a postmortem on the implementation of the two algorithms. What was the biggest challenge in implementing and testing these algorithms?
Note: Postmortem refers to short reviews usually done after completion of a project to set down lessons learned through the project.</description>

      <description>Throughout the semester, you will be working as a group analyzing a network dataset of your choice. The goal is to apply appropriate methodology as we cover it during the semester.
Group membership is listed on piazza: https://piazza.com/class/jldiw9ttj5223l?cid=12
Data Project Lightning Talks: 9&amp;frasl;18 Prepare 5-6 minutes to introduce your group project. Please include
 Who is in the group (including your background)
 What data you plan to work with (as well as you have defined this by Tuesday).</description>
