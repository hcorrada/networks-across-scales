You will implement approximate string matching using a seed-and-check strategy based on exact matching using the Burrows-Wheeler transform. We are providing starter code to get you going. Instructions on implementation and code are here:
https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/hcorrada/cmsc423_project4
I highly, highly recommend that you use git
To get code you will be using for this project using git:</description>

Programming Questions Submit your answers to Problems 4 and 5 in the Rosalind final submission page.
Question 1. (5 pts) Write three or four sentences as a postmortem on the implementation of the two algorithms. What was the biggest challenge in implementing and testing these algorithms?
Note: Postmortem refers to short reviews usually done after completion of a project to set down lessons learned through the project.</description>

      <description>For class we will be using R, Rstudio and git. You can download and install each using the links below. However, you can instead use Rocker, a project built on top of Docker to manage your software installation. We&amp;rsquo;ve setup a container that will provide you with a working installation of R, and the Rstudio IDE, along with a lot of packages providing analysis tools and datasets we will use throughout the semester.</description>
