## The core of data analysis

Given observations (entities), and their characteristics (attributes)

Understand how those characteristics are _distributed_ in the population

- means, variances, empirical distributions
- data generative models with parameters

Hope we can infer something useful about that population from the understanding of the distribution of characteristics

---

## Thinking of networks in terms of data analysis

One way of thinking about networks:

- Entities and their characteristics (nodes and their attributes)
- Interactions and their characteristics (edges and their attributes)

How is the _presence or absence of interactions_ distributed in the population?

---

## Presence/absence models

Consider the analysis of a binary attribute in the population.

E.g., is gene PTEN expressed in normal breast cells?

What is a model we tend to use? Suppose the gene is expressed in `\(p\)` cells in the
population.

I take a sample of `\(N\)` cells, measure how many express PTEN.

---

## Presence/absence models

If we do this sampling experiment many times, we expect to see Binomial distribution

`$$Y \sim Bin(N,p)$$`

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Presence/absence models

What is our expectation for `\(Y\)`?
Variance?

--

For very large `\(N\)`, same distribution is well approximated by `\(Y\sim\mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda=pN)\)`

---

## Presence/absence models

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Presence/absence models

We can follow a similar idea to model presence/absence of an _interaction_ in the network

Given a network over `\(N\)` entities (vertices)

What is the population of interest? All possible pairwise interactions

---

## Presence/absence models

Assumptions:

Fraction `\(p\)` of interactions actually occur in the population

The observed edges is a _realization_ of random occurrences in measurement of those interactions

How can we model the number of edges in a network?

---

## Presence/absence models

`\(Y \sim Bin(N(N-1/2), p)\)`

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Presence/absence models

What if we ask this question _one node at a time_?

If proportion `\(p\)` of interactions actually occur in the population, then 
what is the distribution of the number of interactions (edges) for a single node?

---

## Presence/absence models

`\(k_i \sim Bin(N-1,p)\)`

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Important observations

Expected degree is `\(p(N-1)\)`.

One reasonable estimate from data would be `\(&lt;k&gt;\)` (average degree)

## Power law

We see that exponential decay of high-degree probability does not fit data well.

Log-log plot suggests a linear relationship

`\(\log p_k \approx -\gamma \times \log k\)`

`\(p_k \approx k^{-\gamma}\)`

---

## Power Law

Generative random model for ER (poisson, random) network was straightforward

Next topics:
- Why scale-free?
- Fitting power law networks to data
- Generative random model for power law networks
- More sophisticated models to fit empirical data closer
- Biologically-plausible random models (evolution/fitness etc.)

---

## Power Law

Why scale-free? A couple of ways to think about it:

- The variance of the degree distribution is infinite
- The right-hand tail of the degree distribution does not go to 0

--

_Moments_ of an RV, the expected value of powers of an RV  
`\(E[k]\)` - center of the distribution  
`\(E[k^2]\)` - spread of the distribution (variance) **this is the important one**  
`\(E[k^3]\)` - skew of the distribution  
and more...

---

## Power Law

Why scale-free?

`$$E[k^2] = \sum_{k_{min}}^\infty k^2 p_k = \sum_{k_{min}}^\infty k^{2-\gamma}$$`

--

Let's take some liberties to make this easier to think about

`$$E[k^2] = \int_{k_{min}}^{k_{max}} k^{2-\gamma} dk$$`

and see what happens as `\(k_{max} \to \infty\)`

---

## Power law

.center.image-80[![](img/largesthub.png)]

---

## Power law

`\begin{align}
E[k^2] &amp; = &amp; C\frac{k_{max}^{3-\gamma} - k_{min}^{3-\gamma}}{3-\gamma} \\
{} &amp; = &amp; a k_{max}^{3-\gamma} + b
\end{align}`

- For `\(\gamma &gt; 3\)`: scale is finite value as `\(k_{max}\)` grows  
- For `\(2 \leq \gamma \leq 3\)`: scale is infinite value as `\(k_{\max}\)` grows (scale-free)

---

## Power law

## Estimating the degree coefficient

Since so many structural properties of network depend on this value, estimating it properly matters a lot.

Here is a procedure based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation

---

## Estimating the degree coefficient

.center.image-80[![](img/estimation.png)]

---

## Estimating the degree coefficient

Step 1 - The estimate

Given `\(k_{min}\)`, estimate `\(\gamma\)` as 

`$$\gamma_{k_{min}} = 1 + N\left[ \sum_{i=1}^N \log \frac{k_i}{k_{min}-\frac{1}{2}} \right]^{-1}$$`

---

## Estimating the degree coefficient

Step 2 - How good is it?

`$$D_{k_{min}} = \max_{k \geq k_{min}} |S(k) - p_k|$$`

with `\(p_k\)` given by `\(\gamma_{k_{min}}\)`

---

## Estimating the degree coefficient

Step 3 - Best model fit

Estimate `\(\gamma\)` as `\(\gamma_{k_{min}}\)` that _minimizes_ `\(D_{k_{min}}\)`

---

## Estimating the degree coefficient

Step 4 - Model check

Is the optimal observed deviance `\(D_{k_{min}}\)` consistent with the estimated `\(\gamma\)`?

Generate a distribution of deviance statistics from power law model, check where optimal deviance falls within generated distribution.

---

## Network Generation

The ER model gave use a generative algorithm to create a network that satisifies "Poisson" degree distribution?

Let's see a generative model to obtain a power law network

---

## The Barabasi-Albert Model

Procedure:

- Start with `\(m_0\)` nodes (with arbitrary links, or connected)
- At each time step `\(t\)`
  - Growth: Add a new node with `\(m\)` edges  
  - Preferential attachment: probability new node links to node `\(i\)` `\(\Pi(k_i) = \frac{k_i}{\sum_i k_i}\)`
  
Some simple questions to warm up: (a) how many nodes after `\(t\)` steps? (b) how many edges after `\(t\)` steps?

## Network growth models

Barabasi-Albert, some missing ingredients

- Fitness, properties beyond degree that control preferential attachment
- Age, preferential attachment depending on time
- Death, how to model nodes that go away?

## Network growth models

More importantly: how well does this describe biologically plausible emergence.

Is this consistent with evolution?

## Fitness: Bianconi-Barabasi

Goal: not all nodes of the same degree are equally attractive

.column[
Each node has fitness `\(\eta_i\)`

$$
\Pi(k_i) = \frac{\eta_i k_i}{\sum_j \eta_j k_j}
$$
Dynamics:
`$$k_i(t) = m\left(\frac{t}{t_i}\right)^{\eta_i/C}$$`
]

.center.image-50[![](img/bbdynamics.png)]
]

---

## Fitness: Bianconi-Barabasi

Note: if you have data of network growth, you can estimate fitness coefficient under BB model assumption

---

## Node deletion

In biological networks we often encounter systems in which nodes are removed from networks:

- deleterious mutations in molecular networks
- neuron loss (e.g. AD)
- extinction in ecological networks

Model: at each time step, remove nodes with rate `\(r\)`

---

## Node deletion

Some observations:

- For `\(r&lt;1\)` network grows slighly slower to BA model, so power-law with `\(\gamma=3+\frac{2}{1-r}\)`
- `\(r=1\)` exactly BA model
- For `\(r&gt;1\)` network decays as it grows, analytical model not so clean...

Regimes for deletion important to think about: e.g., removal probability depends on degree (weak-get-weaker)

## Aging

Probability of attachment depends on node age

`$$\Pi(k_i,t_i) \sim k_i(t-t_i)^{\nu}$$`

## Node duplication

An alternative, more biologically plausible network growth model. _New nodes evolve from existing nodes through duplication_

.center.image-60[![](img/duplication.png)]

---

## Node duplication

Procedure:

- Start with seed graph `\(G_0\)` with `\(n_0\)` nodes 
- At each time step `\(t\)`
  - Growth: Create graph `\(G_t\)` by selecting a vertex `\(v_t\)` uniformly at random from graph `\(G_{t-1}\)` and duplicate it by adding new node `\(v\)` with same links as `\(v_t\)`  
  - Deletion: Delete each edge connecting `\(v\)` with probability `\((1-p)\)`  
  - Addition: For each vertex `\(u\)` not connected to `\(v\)`, attach with probability `\(\frac{r}{t+n_0}\)`
  
---

## Node duplication

For large `\(k\)` can show power law

`$$p_k \approx k^{-\gamma}$$`
`$$\gamma=1-\frac{2r}{1-p}$$`

---

## Node duplication

Arguments of fitness, and to a greater degree, node deletion still hold in this case.

---

## Analytical question

Given observed network structure, can we posit a growth model (with associated parameters) that recapitulate observed network structure.

For many biological applications, node duplication with a node deletion regime is a good first place to start

---

## Next time

We briefly saw analysis of some network properties in terms of dynamics

Next we use similar ideas to model processes over data: 
- network diffusion
- network epidemics
- network robustness (percolation)
