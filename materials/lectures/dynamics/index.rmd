## Modeling epidemics over Networks

**Questions**

Are there network properties that predict spread of infection?

Are certain network types more resilient to infection than others?

If we can intervene (vaccinate) are there nodes in the network that are more effective to vaccinate?

--

We'll start by looking at spread over non-networked populations

## Susceptibility and infection (SI model)

.column[
Individuals in the population can be in two states

An infected individual can infect _any_ susceptible individual they are in contact with

If we start ( $t=0$ ) with some number of infected individuals ( $i_0$ ). How many infected individuals are there at time $t$?

## SI model

$$\frac{d}{dt}I(t) = \beta \langle k \rangle \frac{S(t)}{N}I(t)$$

$\langle k \rangle$, average number of contacts per individual in one time step

$\beta$, "rate" probability an I infects an S upon contact

## Epidemic processes over networks (SI)

Consider node $i$ in network:

$s_i(t)$ average probability node $i$ is *susceptible* at time $t$

$x_i(t)$ average probability node $i$ is *infected* at time $t$

---

## Epidemic processes over networks (SI)

$$\frac{ds_i}{dt} = - s_i \beta \sum_{j=1}^N a_{ij}x_j$$

$$\frac{dx_i}{dt} = s_i \beta \sum_{j=1}^N a_{ij} x_j$$

--

For large $N$, and early $t$

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = \beta Ax$$

---
class: split-40

## Eigenvalue decomposition of $A$

.column[
$$A = V^T\Lambda V$$

Any quantity $x_i$ over nodes in the graph can be written as

$$\mathbf{x} = \sum_{r=1}^N c_r \mathbf{v}_r$$
]
.column[
.center.image-50[![](img/evs.png)]
]

---
class: split-40

## Eigenvalue decomposition of $A$

.column[
$$A\mathbf{v}_r = \lambda_r \mathbf{v}_r$$

$$\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_N$$
]
.column[
.center.image-50[![](img/evs.png)]
]

---

## Eigenvalue decomposition of $A$

Let's revisit centrality

$$\mathbf{x}(t) = A^t\mathbf{x}(0)=\sum_{r=1}^N c_r A^t \mathbf{v}_r$$

Then

$$\mathbf{x}(t) = \sum_{r=1}^N c_r \lambda_r^t \mathbf{v}_r=\lambda_1^t \sum_{i=1}^N c_r \left( \frac{\lambda_r}{\lambda_1}\right)^t \mathbf{v}_r$$

---

## Eigenvalue decomposition of $A$

As $t$ grows, first term dominates

$$\mathbf{x}(t) = c_1 \lambda_1^t \mathbf{v}_1$$

So set centrality $\mathbf{x}$ to be proportional to first *eigenvector* $\mathbf{v}_1$

--

In which case $x = Ax$ if $\mathbf{x}=\frac{1}{\lambda_1} \mathbf{v}_1$ as desired

---

## Back to epidemics (SI)

$\mathbf{x}(t)$ average probability each node is infected at time $t$

$$\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \beta A \mathbf{x}$$

Can write as

$$\mathbf{x}(t) = \sum_{r=1}^N c_r(t) \mathbf{v}_r$$

---

## Back to epidemics (SI)

\begin{array}
i\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} & = & \sum_{r=1}^N \frac{dc_r}{dt}\mathbf{v}_r \\
{} & = & \beta A \sum_{r=1}^N c_r(t) \mathbf{v}_r = \beta \sum_{r=1}^N \lambda_r c_r(t) \mathbf{v}_r
\end{array}

--

Implying

$$\frac{dc_r}{dt} = \beta \lambda_r c_r$$

--

With solution

$$c_r(t) = c_r(0) e^{\beta \lambda_r t}$$

---

## Back to epidemics (SI)

As before, first term dominates so

$$\mathbf{x}(t) \sim e^{\beta \lambda_1 t} \mathbf{v}_1$$

Eigen-centrality!

---

## Back to epidemics (SIR)

$$\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \beta A \mathbf{x} - \mu \mathbf{x}$$

Similarily

$$\mathbf{x}(t) \sim e^{(\beta \lambda_1 - \mu)t}$$

--

Is there an epidemic? Not if $R_0=\frac{\beta}{\mu} = \frac{1}{\lambda_1}$

**Degree Block Approximation** Assume that all nodes of the same degree are statistically equivalent
]

.column[
.center.image-60[![](img/degblock.png)]
]

---

## Degree distributions and epidemics

**SI model**

Fraction of nodes of degree $k$ that are infected

$$i_k= \frac{I_k}{N_k}$$ 

$$\frac{di_k}{dt}=\beta(1-i_k)k\Theta_k$$

With $\Theta_k$ the fraction of infected neighbors for a node of degree $k$

---

## Degree distributions and epidemics

For early time and assuming no degree correlation

$$\frac{di_k}{dt} = \beta k i_0 \frac{\langle k \rangle -1}{\langle k \rangle} e^{t/\tau^{SI}}$$

with

$$\tau^{SI}=\frac{\langle k \rangle}{\beta(\langle k^2 \rangle - \langle k \rangle)}$$

---

## Degree distributions and epidemics

**Characteristic time**

$$\tau^{SI}=\frac{\langle k \rangle}{\beta(\langle k^2 \rangle - \langle k \rangle)}$$

For random networks  $\langle k^2 \rangle = \langle k \rangle (\langle k \rangle + 1)$ 

$$\tau^{SI}=\frac{1}{\beta \langle k \rangle}$$

---

## Degree distributions and epidemics

**Characteristic time**

$$\tau^{SI}=\frac{\langle k \rangle}{\beta(\langle k^2 \rangle - \langle k \rangle)}$$

For power law network $\gamma \geq 3$ $\langle k^2 \rangle$ is finite, characteristic time is finite

--

For power law $\gamma < 3$, $\langle k^2 \rangle$ does not converge as $N \to \infty$ so characteristic time goes to 0

---

## Degree distributions and epidemics

.center.middle[![](img/epitab.png)]

---

## Immunization

Suppose a fraction $g$ of nodes is immunized (i.e. resistant)

Rate of infection in SIR model changes from 

$$\lambda=\frac{\beta}{\mu}$$

to

$$\lambda(1-g)$$

---

## Immunization

We can choose a fraction $g_c$ such that rate of infection is below epidemic threshold

For a random network

$$g_c = 1- \frac{\mu}{\beta}\frac{1}{\langle k \rangle + 1}$$

---

## Immunization

For a power-law network

$$g_c = 1-\frac{\mu}{\beta}\frac{\langle k \rangle}{\langle k^2 \rangle}$$

For high $\langle k^2 \rangle$ need to immunize almost the entire population

---

## Immunization

Immunization can be more effective if performed selectively.

In power law contact networks, what is the effect of immunizing high-degree nodes?

--

First, how do you find them?

Idea: choose individuals at random, ask them to nominate a neighbor in contact graph

---

## Summary

- Epidemic as first example of dynamical process over network
- Role of eigenvalue property in understanding epidemic spread
- Role of degree distribution (specifically scale) in understanding spread
- Role of high-degree nodes in robustness of networks to epidemics (immunization)

## Percolation

## Percolation

Let's look at a simplified network growth model (related to ER)

.column[
As nodes are added to the graph

- What is the expected size of the largest cluster?
- What is the average cluster size?
]

.column[
.center[![](img/percolation1.png)]
]

---

## Percolation

There is a critical threshold (percolation cluster $p_c$ )

.center.middle.image-60[![](img/percolation.png)]

---

## Percolation

There is a critical threshold (percolation cluster)

- Average cluster size

$$\langle s \rangle \sim |p-p_c|^{-\gamma_p}$$

- Order parameter ( $P_\infty$ probability node is in large cluster) 

$$P_{\infty} \sim (p-p_c)^{\beta_p}$$

## Critical Failure Threshold

---

## Critical Failure Threshold

Similar modeling strategy applied to general networks

.center.middle[![](img/cft2.png)]

---

## Critical Failure Threshold

First question: is there a giant component?

Molloy-Reed Criterion: Yes, if

$$\frac{\langle k^2 \rangle}{\langle k \rangle} > 2$$

---

## Critical Failure Threshold

For ER: $\langle k^2 \rangle = \langle k \rangle (\langle k \rangle + 1)$

--

There is a large component if

$$\frac{\langle k^2 \rangle}{\langle k \rangle} = \langle k \rangle > 1$$

Good, coincides with what we know

---

## Critical Failure Threshold

Second question: if we model failure as before, when does the giant component disappear?

$$f_c = 1 - \frac{1}{\frac{\langle k^2 \rangle}{\langle k \rangle} - 1}$$

--

For ER:

$$f_c = 1 - \frac{1}{\langle k \rangle}$$

## Robustness to Attacks

What if node removal is targeted to hubs?

.center.middle.image-60[![](img/attacks.png)]

---

## Robustness to Attacks

What if node removal is targeted to hubs?

$$f_c^{\frac{2-\gamma}{1-\gamma}} = 2 + \frac{2-\gamma}{3-\gamma} k_{min} (f_c^{\frac{3-\gamma}{1-\gamma}} - 1)$$

---

## Robustness to Attacks

.center.middle[![](img/sfree_attacks.png)]

---

## Designing Robustness

Hubs - robustness to random attacks
No hubs - robustness to targeted attacks

.center.image-60[![](img/building1.png)]

---

## Designing Robustness

Maximize $$f_c^{tot} = f_c^{random} + f_c^{targeted}$$ 

--

Mixture of nodes 
- fraction $r$ of nodes have $k_{max}$ degree
- remaining $1-r$ nodes have $k_{min}$ degree

## Summary

- Percolation process to understand random failure 
- Defining catastrophic failure as the dissapearance of big cluster
- Catastrophic failure has a critical threshold (relative to fraction of failures)
- Power law degree modulates critical threshold

---

## Summary

- Power law networks are robust to random failures
- Power law networks are susceptible to targeted failures
- Provable robustness to random _and_ targeted failure using mixture of node degrees
