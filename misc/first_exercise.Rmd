```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In this exercise you will create your first submission using R Markdown. We will see more information about R Markdown in class, but you can also take a look below for some preliminary information.

Fill in your answers to the five questions below in the format requested (see example). Knit the file into a PDF and submit on ELMS.

## Loading data

You can use the following snippet, which we also used in the lecture notes used in class:

```{r download, echo=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("BPD_Arrests.csv")) {
  download.file("http://www.hcbravo.org/IntroDataSci/misc/BPD_Arrests.csv", destfile="BPD_Arrests.csv")
}

arrest_tab <- read.csv("BPD_Arrests.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

arrest_tab$race <- factor(arrest_tab$race)
arrest_tab$sex <- factor(arrest_tab$sex)
arrest_tab$incidentOffense <- factor(arrest_tab$incidentOffense)
```
## Example

Use this format for each of the questions below: 
- question: The question, which we provide
- code: The code you used to answer it in an R code chunk
- statement: A succint prose statement (use complete sentences please) of the answer to the question.

**Question 0**: What is the minimum arrest age in the dataset?

```{r q0}
min(arrest_tab$age)
```

The minimum arrest age is 0.

## The questions

**Question 1**: What is the age of the oldest person arrested in the dataset?

**Question 2**: What is the neighborhood with the least number of arrests?

**Question 3**: What is the median arrest age?

**Question 4**: What is the median arrest age in the SOUTHERN district?

**Question 5**: What is the mean age of females arrested in the “Federal Hill” neighborhood?

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
